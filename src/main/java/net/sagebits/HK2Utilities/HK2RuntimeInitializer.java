/**
 * HK2RuntimeInitializer
 * 
 * HK2 currently doesn't provide any mechanism to configure itself via annotations at runtime - instead,
 * it is done via a tool that runs at build time which creates 'inhabitant' files. But having those files
 * around is problematic at best, and makes debugging in Eclipse or other environments difficult, since it
 * relies on having the maven-tool generated file.
 * 
 * This utility alleviates those issues by allowing HK2 to be configured at runtime.
